== Github introduction

=== Owner

Bought by Microsoft a few years ago. It is the most successful Git provider ... but not only.

Competion include: gitlab, bitbucket, gitea ... plenty others. Offers are plan-based pricing and hosted in the cloud by default.

Some of them provide the possibility to host their software inhouse. 

=== Added features

* Issue tracking : Github has issue tracking

* Pull requests : A pull request is a way to ask a repository owner/member to review a change that another member of external person (with public repositories) to review the changes and accept it into the `origin` repository.

* Project management 

* WIKI features

* Automated build & releases

* Automatic security review (dependabot)

A typical use case consists of using Github (or any other similar provider) as a remote repository (with respect to the local or `master` repository).


* Project web site content (https://github.io) 

* Enterprise level features

A repository can be accessed through its URL (or more correctly URI).

The URL for the GIT repository is https://github.com/glory-pscoe/git-training.git[]

.Let's try first from the command line

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/glory-pscoe/git-training.git
# munerotp@LFRCRA02447  /d/co % git clone https://github.com/glory-pscoe/git-training.git
# Cloning into 'git-training'...
