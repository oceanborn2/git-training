== GIT : getting started

=== Distribution 

The distribution for GIT can be found on the 
https://git-scm.com/download[GIT SCM] home page. +

This page also lists client tools. See the list in <<anc-resources>>.


GIT contains two types of clients by default:

* The `git` command line client. This commands has a number of subcommands.

* The `gitui` program acting as a simple graphical interface (based on Tk UI toolkit). footnote:[git-ui.exe on windows]

A good client tool footnote:[A client for GIT is the tool accessing the git repository either locally or on a remote server] for git is https://tortoisegit.org[TortoiseGIT]. As with GIT, the best is to install it with the default settings. footnote:[the line ending characters should be set to Windows for editing locally and Unix for the commits - as defaults]


=== Installation

==== GIT installation

- On Windows, simply run the .MSI installer and pick the default settings.

- On Linux, most of the time there is a package, it is installed already or there is a package available in the distribution package system (apt, pacman ...).

TIP: On Windows, Git includes a UNIX like shell footnote:[mingw64]. Shell commands are available: `git-bash` footnote:[recommended] and also a `git-cmd` commands.
